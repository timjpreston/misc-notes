use 99% of the time

FaaS - function as a service - event driven

Serverless - more ops then dev!

serveless - super advance cloud

historically

physical servers
virtual servers
instance
managed instances
containers

even with containers - still maintain server

faas = more complex to manage

scale is easy - but complexity of system in increased

Faas

simon wardley

faas - decompoae  function

cost is minimal
decouple logic
no bulky frameworks

events and queues
events are key
no syncronous flows - need to be Asyncronus
push and poll

data driven designs
dyanodb rather than RDMS

need to do infrastruture as a service - tarra form or cloudformation

deployment and CI/CD
canarying
blue/green?
no staged roll out

ARN?

unit testnig easy
other testing is different
lamda is smaller than microservices
microservices may be 10 lambda functions
end to end testing can be problamatic

need infrastucture as code for staginging environment.

smaller codebase
different skills

servers harder to maintain
serverless - manitain a Infrastructure as code solution

1% that doest work with serverless

#1 Real time system - doest fir with serverless
#2 Compute intensive tasks  0r sequential and parallel tasks eg Mapreduce
#3 Very mission critical systems -
#4 Where you need real control - regulatory
